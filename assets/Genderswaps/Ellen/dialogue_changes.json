The streets are packed with people... they either seem in a mad hurry, or lost in a daze, unaware of their surroundings. I miss Pelican Town already!^^I begin the tour this evening, at a local bookstore. I must admit, I'm becoming a bit nervous at the thought of public speaking... my stomach feels as if it's been twisted into a soft pretzel and doused with spicy cheese dip. Wish me luck!^^-Love, {{Elliott}}^^P.S. I hope you had a peaceful night, and weren't too scared all alone in that big house! %item conversationTopic ElliottGone2 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife",

Still, I sold enough copies of the book to pay for my (bug-infested) hotel room!^^In a few hours, I leave for Zuzu City. If yesterday's reading was a warm-up, this next one will be a true napalm blast...^^I miss you very much. Remember to eat well! Oh, and don't forget the leftover crab cakes I put in the fridge...^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone3 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 2",

It seems there's a large literary scene here... a few dozen people showed up at my reading!^^I even signed a couple of autographs... it's strange to be seen as someone important. It's all a matter of framing, a grand illusion... for truly I am no one special. Only your devoted {{Elliott}}, as always.^^Currently I'm alone, in my hotel room, 'ingesting' a Joja Value Meal...^^Should this be called 'food'?^Or 'edible matter'?^I needn't long brood^It must be the latter^^I look forward to returning home soon.

I can't wait to return and see what progress has been made.^^On these long travels between towns, I amuse myself by closing my eyes and envisioning the farm... I see kegs pulsing with sweet wine, a furnace ablaze with precious ore, and our little kitchen with the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a lot to enjoy!^^Just don't stay out too late in the mines, my love. It's dangerous in there!

It's been nice to meet people who enjoy my work, but I'm eager to return home.^^I look forward to the comfort of our little house, the satisfying farm work, a home-cooked meal, and most of all, cozying into the flannel sheets with you.^^See you soon!^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone7 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 6"
