If you’d like the full [u]Anthro Characters[/u] experience for 1.6, we suggest holding off playing with this mod for now! The patch on this page is just the 1.5 content uplifted to 1.6 for those who really want to play [i]today[/i].

[b][u]Anthro Characters[/u] overhauls virtually every NPC in the game, creating a wholly re-imagined Stardew Valley experience for those who enjoy anthropomorphic animal characters.[/b] And now it is compatible with Stardew 1.6!
